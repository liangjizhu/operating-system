  - `Makefile`: Makefile for compiling the minishell project.
  - `checker_os_p2.sh`: Shell script for checking the minishell project.

- `labs/lab1`
  - `myishere.c`: C program to check if a file exists in a directory.
  - `myls.c`: C program to list files in a directory.
  - `mywc.c`: C program to count lines, words, and bytes in a file.

- `labs/lab3`
  - `queue.c`: C program for queue implementation.
  - `store_manager.c`: C program for store management using queues.

- `T1-system-calls/C-code`
  - Various C programs related to system calls.

- `T2-processes/C-code`
  - Various C programs related to process creation and management.

- `T4-communication/Exercises-pipes-Ccode`

## How to Use

To compile and run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the code you want to compile.
2. Use the provided Makefile (if available) to compile the code by running the `make` command.
3. If no Makefile is provided, compile the code using the `gcc` compiler. For example:
   ```
   gcc -o output_file source_file.c
   ```
4. Run the compiled executable. For example:
   ```
   ./output_file
   ```

Note: Some directories may contain specific instructions or additional scripts for compiling and running the code. Refer to the README files or comments within the code for more details.
